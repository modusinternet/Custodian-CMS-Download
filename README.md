<h1 align="center">Custodian CMS Download</h1>

Some of the code for this utility comes from Marko MarkoviÄ‡'s project the [Simple PHP Git deploy script](https://github.com/markomarkovic/simple-php-git-deploy).

[Custodian CMS](https://github.com/modusinternet/Custodian-CMS) (CCMS) is a PHP driven Content Management System designed to help build and maintain multilingual websites.

The CCMS Download script is a single template designed to help test your server environment and download the latest version of the CCMS repo easily. It saves you the trouble of downloading the compressed files or running composer and installing them yourself by hand.

## System Requirements
* `PHP v5.6+`
* `git` and `rsync` are required on the server that's running the script.
	- Optionally: `tar` is required for backup functionality (`BACKUP_DIR` option).
	- Optionally: `composer` is required for composer functionality (`USE_COMPOSER` option).
* System user running PHP (IE: `www-data`) needs to have the necessary access permissions to the `TMP_DIR` and `TARGET_DIR` locations.

## Instructions
Download a copy of the `ccms-download.php` template to the folder on your server you want to install CCMS, make changes to any #define variables required and change the `SECRET_ACCESS_TOKEN` (SAT) variable to something only you know and call it from your browser. IE:
https://example.com/ccms-download.php?sat=YourSATString

## Gotchas
Calling `ccms-download.php` without the SAT variable, forgetting to update it to something other than the default or mistyping it in your URI will result in an 'ACCESS DENIED!' error message.  Don't panic, this is by design for your safety and security. Just double check your work, make the necessary changes, and try again.
